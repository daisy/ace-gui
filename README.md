# Ace, the desktop application 

A desktop graphical user interface for [Ace](https://daisy.github.io/ace), the EPUB accessibility checker by the [DAISY Consortium](http://daisy.org).

<br/>


## Getting started

The Ace application is distributed as a self-contained application package; there is no prerequisite to install the application.

After you download the application from the [release page](https://github.com/daisy/ace-gui/releases), please follow the instructions below:

- **on macOS**: open the disk image (`.dmg` file), then copy or drag-and-drop the application to your installation folder of choice (we recommand installing Ace to your default `/Applications` folder).
- **on Windows**: open the executable installer (`.exe`), and follow the step-by-step installation process. Ace will launch automatically after the installation; shortcuts will be created on the desktop and in the application menu.

The first time Ace launches, it may take a few seconds to render a usable user interface (this is a know issue, weâ€™re still in beta!). Once loaded, youâ€™ll see an invitation to open an EPUB, which can be done by pressing the "Check EPUB" button, the "Check EPUB" menu item, or by drag-and-dropping an EPUB to the main window. Once an EPUB is opened, Ace will automatically start checking it and render the report.

## Development

### Technology stack

The Ace desktop application is based on the following technologies:

- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), an open source library to build cross-platform applications with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/), a component-based library fo building user interfaces.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), a state-container for Javascript appllications.
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), a set of React components that implement the Material Design guidelines

The application's build system is based on:
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), a static module bundler for Javascript applications.
- [Electron Builder](https://www.electron.build/), a solution to package and build Electron applications with installers and updaters.
